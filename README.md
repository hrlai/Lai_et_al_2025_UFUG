Welcome! This repository stores the modelling code for the paper

> Lai, H. R., Burcham, D. C., Wang, J. W., Stouffer, D. B., Qiu, D. W., & Yee, A. T. K. (2025). Quantifying life-history trade-offs in diameter growth for tropical tree species from a large urban inventory dataset. _Urban Forestry and Urban Greening_, 112, 128982. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128982

At the time of publication, the publisher forgot to add the link to our open codes here. I hope the search engines bring you here at some point.

# Usage

Simply go to the `code` folder and see the R script. Hopefully it is self-explanatory, feel free to contact me via email or lodge an [Issue](https://github.com/hrlai/Lai_et_al_2025_UFUG/issues) otherwise.

# Notes

This project has taken many years to accomplish. My brain is foggy. I might have missed uploading something, if so feel free to get in touch. Our model is far from perfect, you should use it bearing in mind that lots can probably be improved / tailored to your own project. Anyway, have fun!
